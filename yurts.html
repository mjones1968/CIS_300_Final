          <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
          <dd>Our luxury yurts are permament structures four feet off the ground.<br>
          Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a <br>
          roof dome that can be opened</dd>

          <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
          <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and <br>
          gas-fired stove.  Your luxury camping experience includes electricity <br>
          and a sink with hot and cold running water.  Shower and restroom <br>
          facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

          <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
          <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for <br>
          changing weather with light layers of clothing.  It's also helpful to <br>
          bring a flashlight and a sense of adventures!</dd>
